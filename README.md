# FT2G25

A simple python script that converts FTDNA's MyOriginsV3 results to a simulated G25 coordinate!

## How do I run it?

2. Replace the 0s with the percentages that FTDNA's MyOriginsV3 gave you
3. (Linux) Open terminal in the directory and run _FT2G25.py_ using Python 3
4. (Windows) Run the _FT2G25.bat_ file
